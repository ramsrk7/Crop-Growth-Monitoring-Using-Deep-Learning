# Crop-Growth-Monitoring-Using-Deep-Learning

There are many systems already employed for crop monitoring, using remote sensing and machine learning. The existing systems monitor parameters such as temperature, soil pH, soil moisture. Also, with the advent of machine learning, work has been employed towards apple growth stages evaluated using Deep learning. Also, many machine learning models employed for crop disease, pesticide control, weed management, irrigation control.
But the challenge in all these systems is that there has been no work that have concentrated on crop growth. The crop growth monitoring could help farmers to assess the stage which could help farmers to take early action before it drastically affects the entire farm.
So, taking all the above systems into consideration, we here have developed a cost-efficient system to automatically evaluate the stages of the crop growth and predict the health of crop using different CNN models. We trained models with different CNN architectures such as VGG19, Xception, MobileNet2 and have compared their performance using different metrics. The image dataset used to train the model was taken from the web and were compiled manually. The results obtained from validating the models with the test dataset indicate that MobileNetV2 model will be effective in keeping the health of the crop in check deployed in smaller sized devices like Mobile phone followed by Xception model.
